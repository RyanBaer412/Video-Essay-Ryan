I feel like I still can do some more research on my topic and to sample a little more effects. 
I am going to do more research on how to use premier pro so I can take my project to the next level. I explained how AI is effecting the way education is happening now. AI is making it harder for teachers to do their jobs because they have to do more work checking to make sure that kids are not just using AI. AI is also going to make educators have to decide whether or not AI is good for kids and if they should allow it. What the main topic I really dove into was how AI is affecting our critical thinking skills, and our ability to do stuff on our own. My main point was that AI could be a very big help to us if we let it be, it does not have to be a burden to us. If we use AI to enhance our work instead of using it as a tool to do our work for us it could be very helpful.
